 Write a function is_older that takes two dates and evaluates to true or false.  It evaluates to true if the first argument is a date that comes before the second argument.  (If the two dates are the same, the result is false.)

Write a function get_nth that takes a list of strings and an int  n and returns the nth element of the list where the head of the list is 1st.  Do not worry about the case where the list has too few elements: your function may apply hd or tl to the empty list in this case, which is okay.

Write a function date_to_string that takes a date and returns astring of the form January 20, 2013 (for example).  Use the operator ^ for concatenating strings and the library function Int.toString for converting an int to astring.  For producing the month part, donotuse a bunch of conditionals.Instead, use a list holding 12 strings and your answer to the previous problem.  For consistency, put a comma following the day and use capitalized English month names:  January, February, March, April,May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.

Write a function number_before_reaching_sum that takes an int called sum, which you can assume is positive, and an int list, which you can assume contains all positive numbers, and returns an int.You should return an int n such that the first n elements of the list add to less than sum, but the first n+ 1 elements of the list add to sum or more.
